# Python Flask boilerplate project, deployable to Heroku

Intended for use on VSCode Docker devcontainer, should work out of the box. Note that Docker is used for local development only, the deployment to Heroku is not containerized.

## Setup
- Make sure you have Docker and the Visual Studio Code extension _Remote - Containers_ (id: ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) installed locally.
- Clone this repo.
- Open folder in Visual Studio Code, it should suggest to _Reopen in container_. If not, choose _Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container_ from the Command Palette.
- Try running the app with `flask run` in the VSCode terminal, it shoult open in your browser (VSCode will tell you the URL)

## Deployment to Heroku
- The files _Procfile_, _wsgi.py_ and _runtime.txt_ contain all the info Heroku needs to run the app.
- Create the Heroku app with `heroku create` in the VSCode terminal.
- Try running the app locally  with `heroku local` (basically the same as `flask run`, but now we want to make sure Heroku can start the app as well.)
- Deploy with `git push heroku main` 
- Wait for the deploy script to run, then visit the deployed app in your browser using the url provided by the script!
